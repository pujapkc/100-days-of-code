Lisa just got a new math workbook. A workbook contains exercise problems, grouped into chapters. 
Lisa believes a problem to be special if its index (within a chapter) is the same as the page number where it's located. The format of Lisa's book is as follows:-

There are n chapters in Lisa's workbook, numbered from 1 to n .
The ith chapter has arr[i] problems, numbered from 1 to arr[i] .
Each page can hold up to k problems. Only a chapter's last page of exercises may contain fewer than k problems.
Each new chapter starts on a new page, so a page will never contain problems from more than one chapter.
The page number indexing starts at 1.
